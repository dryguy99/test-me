To operate project:

      clone repository
      navigate to directory 'test-me'
      npm install
      open another window and run: mongod
      open another window and run: npm run oldstart
      then in the current window run: node server
        or you may run: nodeman server

all project files need to be in the src folder so they are compiled for the final build.
all html needs to be in react jsx.
